# YTS-Torrent-Server
This is an application that displays movies from the YTS database and the user can initiate a download which then downloads the movie to their machine and sends the progress status back to the mobile app and web app.

**Note** In case you would not want to use the web client and only use the android app or vice versa then you can skip installing it.

## Setup
1. Clone the project and follow all the instructions in each of the individual modules.  
2. Create a new firebase project and register a new android application and web project. 
3. Deploy the express server to firebase cloudfunctions.
4. Set up the download server.
5. Install the android app on your phone or set up the web client or do both !
